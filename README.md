# Treasure Hunt Game




Welcome to Escape The Island! This is a simple web-based game where you have to escape from a strange jungle by solving riddles with the help of certain clues. You can use your mouse to click on different locations and see if you can discover any clues or items. The game is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase.




## How to play




To start the game, you need to sign in with your email account. Firstly, you will get to know the backstory about how you crashed into the jungle. Then, you will have to solve the riddles and get to the final/result page.




The goal of the game is to solve all the riddles and escape from the jungle you are trapped in. At certain levels, you have to solve the riddle in the required time. At some levels, you will get choices, and if you choose the wrong option, the game will be over. If you use hints/clues to answer the riddles, points will be deducted from your total score. You can use the clue button to get the clue for the riddle. At the end of the game, you will be either escorted out of the island by a boat or a helicopter.




The game ends when you come across all the difficulties, run out of time, or reach a dead end. At the final step, the score and accuracy will be shown to you. In any step, if you reach a dead end, you will be redirected to the starting page.

## Escaping the jungle!

The game starts with a story that depicts how a plane crashes into a jungle. When you press the continue button, a login/signup page opens up. You are required to login to the game using your username and password. For the completion of the game, we only have two correct paths. Now, to start the game, you should click on ‘Start The Adventure’ button. In the next step, a riddle is given to you with a timer of 25 seconds. You should click on the white item (first aid) present on the bottom right of the image. This takes you to the next level. At this level, you are asked to click on the image of an aeroplane, which then comes up with three choices: a battery, water, and a telephone. On the aeroplane, a number is written. You have to remember that number, which will be helpful in the future. Now, if you chose battery, you will be asked to ignite the fire. By pressing on the respective item, you are redirected to the next page, i.e., you made the wrong choice because batteries should not be used to ignite fire. This is the dead end of the game. If, in the choices, you chose water, you are redirected to the next level, where you have to rearrange the items to make a number, which acts like a key for the next level. Here, the answer is 235. After pressing the submit button, you should click on the map, and here is the map of the whole jungle. At the next level, you need to find an apple with a cut, which is the only answer to the riddle. Clicking on it will open the next page. Now, you are encountered with an animal. For your life's security, you need to decode the riddle, for which the answer is ‘run from here’. Clicking on the submit button will open the next level, in which you have to click on the boat, which in response opens up a form in which you need to enter your name and the number written on the aeroplane. Submitting the form will complete the game.
Now, if the choice you made was telephone, in the next level, you have to hover over the telephone symbol and read the message carefully on the screen. After reading and pressing the OK button, the next level opens up. In this level, you have to rearrange the items to make a number, which acts like a key for the next level. Here, the answer is 235. After pressing the submit button, you should click on the map, and here you get a map of the whole jungle, and on the map you can see that there is a helicopter at the other tip of the island. In the next level, you have to arrange the images to make a complete apple. When the image of the apple is complete, press the submit button, and you will be redirected to the next level. Now, click on the image, and you need to select ‘E', which depicts the east direction. You will get to know this direction if you have carefully read the message on the telephone. If you select ‘W’ here, the game is over, i.e., you made the wrong choice and encountered a dead end. Selecting the correct direction will redirect you to the next riddle, whose answer is flaregun. After submitting your answer, you will get to the next level, in which you have to fill out the form by entering your name and the aeroplane number. Submitting the form will complete the game.

            Congratulations, you have completed the game. Now you can either play again or see your result by pressing the respective button.
